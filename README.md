# 🌐 IoT Monitor Service

Monitor Service - An integrated system for managing and monitoring IoT devices, built with 
 - **Node.js**, 
 - **C++ (Arduino/ESP)**
 - **TimescaleDB**
 - **MQTT**

This project combines firmware for microcontrollers, backend services, and monitoring tools.

## 📁 Repositories

The whole project is based on different components, split on several repositories

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [iot-monitor-service](https://github.com/daemonzone/iot-monitor-service) | Node.js **monitoring and control service**, interacting with the backend |  
| [iot-clients-esp32](https://github.com/daemonzone/iot-clients-esp32) | **C++ client sketches** for Wemos / ESP32 |
| [iot-clients-node](https://github.com/daemonzone/iot-clients-node) | **Node.js clients** for newer Raspberry/OrangePi devices | 
|  [iot-clients-node-legacy](https://github.com/daemonzone/iot-clients-node-legacy) | Node.js clients for **older devices** (Armbian v3, mqtt4) | 
|  [iot-monitor-api](https://github.com/daemonzone/iot-monitor-api) | **API interface** to retrieve devices and telemetry from TimescaleDB |
|  [iot-monitor-dashboard](https://github.com/daemonzone/iot-monitor-dashboard) | React **Web Dashboard** for device charts |

## ⚙️ Overview

### 🛰️ IoT Monitor Service
A **Node.js service** responsible for:
  - Identifying devices connected and allowed to send telemetry data
  - Receiving telemetry from devices  
  - Persisting data into TimescaleDB  
  - Initializing database tables and hypertables  
  - _Sending commands to devices (wip)_

### 🧠 Wemos / ESP32 Clients
For IoT nodes based on **ESP8266 / ESP32** microcontrollers (i.e Wemos D1 mini)
Each device has its own unique identifier
Each device announces itself on a MQTT queue, being identified by the monitoring service.
Each device periodically publishes telemetry and status (e.g. temperature, humidity, status) to a per-device MQTT queue

### 💻 NodeJs Clients
Node.js based client code available for micro-computers (like Raspberry or Orange Pi)

### 🕹️ NodeJs Clients (legacy)
Node.js v10 based client code available for older micro-computers (running Armbian v3.4.113)

### 🌐 IoT Monitor API
A **Node.js service** responsible for:
  - Collecting and storing device telemetry into TimescaleDB  
  - Exposing REST endpoints to query device data and status  

### 🖥️ IoT Monitor Dashboard
A **React Web Interface** to:
  - Visualize real-time device status and historical telemetry  
  - Display charts for temperature, humidity, uptime, and other metrics  
  - Filter, sort, and explore devices and their readings

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/daemonzone/iot-monitor.git
   cd iot-monitor-service

2. Install **iot-monitor-service** dependencies

   _**Requires node >= 20_ 
   ```
   cd iot-monitor-service
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the environment
   Copy .env.example to .env and fill in with Database and MQTT parameters:

   ```
   MQTT_BROKER_URL=mqtt://localhost
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost/iot
   ```

4. Run the iot-monitor-service
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   ### 🚀 Console output

   ```
